            <h3>A tiny home is a stand alone structure ranging from 100 to 400 square feet</h3>
            <p>This website serves as a platform to record our own tiny home design-build process and to share the knowledge, research, and ideas acquired along the way.<br><br>Our interest in a tiny home stems from a variety of sources, namely financial, environmental and lifestyle pursuits. By collaborating with architects, engineers, designers, planners, building code officials, product manufacturers, and lifestyle enthusiasts, we intend to create an off-grid tiny home for less than $30,000 USD.<br><br>The above will result in this website's comprehensive guide to designing, building, and maintaining a tiny home. The guide will include an explanation of codes and regulations, design and layout, building systems, material and product selection, and construction and maintenance techniques.</p>

                <h2>Electric Power</h2>
                <p>Electricity for tiny house can either be grid connected or off-grid. Off-grid systems include solar-electric, wind-electric, or wind-solar hybrid. This section will cover solar electric system componenets and desing and provide design options for grid-connected system layouts. </p>

                <h2>Structure</h2>
                <p>The structure is the shell of the tiny house and it is made up of the floor system, wall system, and roof system. This sections provides design options for different structural systems and associated constrcution details. </p>

                <h2>Appliances & Furnishings</h2>
                <p>Due to space limitation and reduced energy consumption, tiny houses rely on transforming furniture and energy efficient appliances. This section will provide a survey of furniture and appliances specifically selected for tiny house design. </p>

                <h2>Water Treatment & Sanitation</h2>
                <p>Water treatment and sanitation can either utlize grid-connected systems though municiple infrastructure or off-grid systems through rainwater catchment systems and composting toilets. We will discuss in-depth off-grid solutions and provide design options for grid-connected system layouts. </p>

                <h2>Foundation</h2>
                <p>The foundation is the lowest part of the tiny house and it's main function is to transfer the loads of the structure safely to the ground. We will take a look at tiny house trailers and permenant foundations as solutions to tiny house foundations. </p>

                <h2>Sustaniable Design</h2>
                <p>Sustainable design techniques are crucial for the success of tiny house life style. Relying on natural light and ventilation are the very basics to reducing energy consumption and enhancing indoor living quality. We will discuss active and passive design approaches and provide case study examples for all options in this section. </p>

                <h2>Thermal Comfort & Air Quality</h2>
                <p>Thermally conditioning tiny houses through heating, venting, and air conditioning (HVAC) is crucial for maintaining a healthy indoor air quality (IAQ).This section will cover the necessary HVAC equipment and associated air monitoring devices. </p>

                <h2>Building Code & Motor Laws</h2>
                <p>Because tiny house are commonly on wheels, they have to abide to both building codes and motor laws. Currently, building codes are being developed specifically for tiny houses and motor laws govern vehicle size limits and associated permits. </p>
